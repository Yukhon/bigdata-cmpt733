    "Data scientists often spend 80% of their time on [data preparation](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html). If your career goal is to become a data scientist, you have to master data cleaning and data integration skills. In this assignment, you will learn how to solve the Entity Resolution (ER) problem, a very common problem in data cleaning and integration. After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is ER?\n",
    "2. What are the applications of ER in data integration and cleaning? \n",
    "3. How to avoid $n^2$ comparisons? \n",
    "4. How to compute Jaccard Similarity?\n",
    "5. How to evaluate an ER result?\n",

    "1. Please use [pandas.DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) rather than spark.DataFrame to manipulate data.\n",

    "ER is defined as finding different records that refer to the same real-world entity, e.g., iPhone 4-th generation vs. iPhone four. It is central to data integration and cleaning. In this assignment, you will learn how to apply ER in a data integration setting. But the program that you are going to write can be easily extended to a data-cleaning setting, being used to detect _duplication values_.   \n",

Since the same product may have different representations in the two websites, you are facing an ER problem. \n",

    "1. Jaccard is used to quantify the similarity between two sets instead of two records. You need to convert each record to a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A naive implementation of similarity join is to compute Jaccard for all $|R \\times S|$ possible pairs. Imagine R and S have one million records. This requires doing 10^12 pair comparisons, which is extremely expensive. Thus, you need to know how to avoid n^2 comparisons. \n",
